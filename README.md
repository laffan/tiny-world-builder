# Tiny World Builder

This is a simplest-possible demo to build tiny worlds with. Included is a character with basic movement control, a Tiled project file and some a helper script (useImageCollections.js) to assist with the import of image collections that have been used in object layers.

## Using useImageCollections.js

Basic usage is laid out in the code itself, denoted by numbered ðŸŒº emojis. You'll see 1, 2 & 3 in Level1_Preload.js, alongside #4 in Level1_Pixel.js, when image keys are being accessed. 

## Credits
The main code is simply a mashup of [Nathan Altice's demos](https://github.com/nathanaltice), with special emphasis on [mappy](https://github.com/nathanaltice/Mappy) for the tiled integration and physics setup, alongside [FSM]( https://github.com/nathanaltice/FSM) for player movement & animations.
